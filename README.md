# Steam Idler
Used for idling in games which allows you to get cards without actually being in the game or even having it installed.

## Download
[Get the latest compiled version from the releases page.](https://github.com/svilenmarkov/steam-idler/releases/latest/download/build.zip)

## Usage
Open the `idler.exe` file and enter the game App ID. This is the number found in the URL of a game's store page. For example DOOM Eternal's store page is https://store.steampowered.com/app/782330/DOOM_Eternal/ and its App ID is `782330`. After entering the ID you should see yourself as being in the game on Steam. When you're done with getting the cards you can close the window and open it again with a new ID.

**You must own the game and you must have the Steam client running.**

## Building it yourself

`.NET v4`

Running the `build.ps1` should suffice so long as you have `csc.exe` in your environment path. You may have to disable the execution policy.
